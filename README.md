# Product Inventory Manager

Numerous restaurants, groceries, retailers and individuals may face issues
related to managing their product inventories, especially when it comes to food.

This project aims to solve this problem. This product inventory manager is a
webapp that will allow users to keep a tab on their inventories or other items
as well as to create alerts whenever perishables will spoil or will be depleted.

</br>

## Project Charter

This is the project charter for the Product Inventory Manager. This application
will be delivered as a web application for our Software Engineering class.

</br>

### **Project Description**

This web application is aimed to allow the users a way to easily manage their
inventories through the use of an intuitive interface. The aim of the project is
to address the need restaurants, groceries, retailers, and individuals may have
when dealing with the preservation of their inventories.

</br>

### **Project Objectives**

Facilitate the management of items to groceries, retailers, and restaurants or
individual users via a web application.

</br>

### **Scope**

The scope of the project is to deliver to the user a functional web application
that will allow them to easily manage their item inventories in an intuitive
way.

</br>

### **Out of Scope**

As of the moment, we are not considering implementing integrating third party
systems such as the integration of POS capabilities or anything that is not
specified in the [**_Key Characteristics_**](#key-characteristics) section.

</br>

### **Business Case**

Several individuals may face issues whenever they need to manage large amounts
of items. This may bring problems such spoiling food, oversized inventories,
depletion of popular items, among other issues.

This web application is aimed to tackle these problems.

</br>

### **Key Characteristics**

- **_Inventory Upload and Update_**

  - The user will be able to upload items and update their quantities by
    entering data like the product name, quantity received, vendor, and Universal
    Product Code (UPC).

  - This will allow to eliminate material waste by cycling through the user's
    inventory in a periodic basis.

  - It will also enable the user to know thir stock level in real
    time.

  - Better control of item costs.

  - This will help users minimize human error as well.

- **_Low-Stock Inventory Alerts_**

  - The webapp will notify the user whenever a product is about to spoil or run
    out.

- **_Reports_**

  - Analytics and reports will provide the user with a thorough picture of their
    finances, performance, and periodic activities.

  - The analysis of this information will enable the user to increase their
    efficiency as well as profitability.

  - The reports will include stock levels, profitability, and sales performance
    (the latter two will only be available to groceries or restaurants).

    - **Stock reports** let the user stay updated on what items they curently
      have available.

    - **Profitability reports** can help the user visualize their income flow by
      comparing outflows with inflows. Also, they will be able to know their
      profit margins for items.

    - **Sales reports** will let the user see which items are not selling as
      well as the others so they could consider removing them. Additionally, they
      can quickly tell which items are the least ordered and most ordered to make
      sure they have it on stock.

</br>

### **Constraints**

- **_Quality:_** prioritize the quality of the project over time.

- **_Time:_** 4 months.

- **_Scope:_** as specified in the [**_Scope_**](#scope) section.

</br>

### **Risks**

The following have been identified as risks that could contribute to not making
scope or schedule:

- Difficulty adapting and implementing a key characteristic into the
  application.

- Having to use a technology that we have never used before.

</br>

### **Success Criteria**

The project will be considered to have met all the neccesary criteria when all
of the [**_Key Characteristics_**](#key-characteristics) are fully implemented.
